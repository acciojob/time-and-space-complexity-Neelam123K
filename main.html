	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
    Time complexity refers to the computational time an algorithm takes to run, relative to the size of its input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, allowing them to process large inputs quickly.
  </p>
	<p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. When we say an algorithm has a space complexity of O(n), it means that the memory used grows linearly with the input size.
